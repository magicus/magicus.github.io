This is my blog. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

My real name is Magnus Ihse Bursie; my friends most often call me &#8220;Ihse&#8221;. I&#8217;ve been a computer geek since my first ZX Spectrum.

On this blog, I intend to share some of my enthusiasm, ideas and rants about technology with you. Welcome.
