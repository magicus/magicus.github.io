title: "First post!"

So, it seems I’ve gotten myself a blog. Keepin’ up with the times, heh? I’ve tried doing things like this before (even though it wasn’t called “blog” back then), but never succeeded in keeping them updates.

This time, however, I have a somewhat more narrow focus, which will hopefully help me to determine what to post, and when.

My intention is to write about technology; cool technology, new technology, technology with good usability. Ubiquitous technology. And about a hobby of mine: to run Linux on as many weird hardware targets as possible. :-D
